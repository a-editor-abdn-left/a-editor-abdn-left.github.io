      <description>there is a view among some sections of the communist left that sees humans as destined to expand into the galaxy, and what’s more that we are entitled to do this and a great many other things in some way “against” nature because we are a “higher species”. I hope you will follow along with me as I lay out the undeniable straight line that passes through this view of ourselves as a species, from an imperialist &amp;amp; fascist worldview straight through to a justification and argument for any number of atrocities.</description>
